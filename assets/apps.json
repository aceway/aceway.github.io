It carries solids, surfaces, assemblies—clean, structured, and painfully strict. No flair, no shortcuts, just geometry described the way engineers wish the world behaved.  It isn’t perfect. Files get heavy, exporters cut corners, and interpretations drift.  But when you need 3D data that survives the jump from one system to another, STEP is still the steady, quietly reliable workhorse everyone ends up trusting."
